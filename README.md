## How to play

The player stands in the middle of the webcam screen with arms by their sides. A question will appear on the screen and the player can choose their answer based on the letters on the four quadrants of the screen. 

When a correct answer is chosen, a fish is added to the ocean. If a wrong answer is given, a fish is killed off. A countdown clock is given for each question and the player is required to provide an answer within the given time. 

If the player runs out of fish, they lose the game or if they have accumulated 50 fish, they have won the game!
