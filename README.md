# Ocean Fusion

## Project Overview

Ocean Fusion is an interactive trivia game that brings awareness about environmental sustainability. Our primary goal was to provide a fun, interactive experience to raise awareness and increase efforts to protect natural resouces. Our focus audience is young children, which is why we integrated PoseNet and animation that changes with the progression of the game.

## How to play

The player stands in the middle of the webcam screen with arms by their sides. A question will appear on the screen and the player can choose their answer by placing their left or right wrist on one of the letters on the screen. When the player answers a question correctly, fish will appear in the ocean!

The player will win the game if they can answer FIVE questions correctly in ONE minute. If not, they will have the option to play again!
